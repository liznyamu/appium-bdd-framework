# Appium - TDD Framework Design

## Framework plan
- [x] Avoid code duplication
- [x] Improve code readability
- [x] Scalable automation
- [x] Wait and Driver commands handling
- [x] Use Explicit Waits
- [x] Modular, independent test cases
- [x] Parameterization
- [x] Exception Handling
- [x] Add abstraction layer for test data
- [x] Add abstraction layer for static text
- [x] Multiple platform support - iOS and Android
- [x] Add More Test Classes / Defining common elements
- [x] Failure recovery / Fail safe test cases
  - using @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod
- [x] Scrolling - Different Scrolling Mechanisms
- [x] Capture Screenshots/Videos
- [x] Parallel Execution on Android and iOS
  - *Why ?* 
    - to increase test coverage by executing the application on multiple devices
    - to reduce the test execution time even when we execute the automation on multiple devices
